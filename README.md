#### Using --s argument

- `play --s faded_alan_walker --g` = For downloading and playing song from youtube. Remember to search it by passing --s argument and value having `_` instead of space.
- And use `--g` argument for playing song while using `--s` argument instead of `--t` as it often time gives this error - _A problem occurred in initializing MCI_
